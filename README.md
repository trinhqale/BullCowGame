# 03_BullCowGame
This project was following GameDev.tv tutorial.

A simple game that the player has to guess an isogram (no repeating letters) with the length of 4-8. 
All the rules are written in the game. 
(Added "cheatcode" that let players know a random letter from the hidden word)

In order to run source code on Unreal Engine, find 'Terminal' -> 'Add New Component' -> choose 'BullCowCartridge' 

Outcomes: 
+ Get familiar with Unreal Engine 4.
+ understand the structure of a simple game.
